# Networking 
The core connector template is setup to expose two servers on two seperate ports.

![Ports](/images/Networking.png)

One server is supposed to handle requests from the DFSP and the other port is supposed handle and receive requests from the Mojaloop Connector.

The port allocation is as follows

- 3004 DSFP Server
- 3003 Mojaloop Connector Server.

Requests should be directed respectively. When configuring the a payment manager deployment, let the URL for the core connector point to the Mojaloop Connector server port. Such that the requests from the mojaloop connector are handled accordingly.
