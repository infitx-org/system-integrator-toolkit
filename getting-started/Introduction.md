Everything you need to know about Mojaloop System Integration.
# Getting Started
The SI toolkit aims to provide comprehensive documentation to facilitate an organization's integration into an instant and inclusive payment system powered by Mojaloop. It offers resources tailored to various stakeholders, covering both business and technical perspectives. The documentation is organized into sections, each addressing the unique needs of specific stakeholder groups involved in the integration process.

Here we have provided links to the documentation that will be relevant to a system integrator looking to address the concerns of specific stakeholders during an integration.

## Management
This stakeholder group includes anyone in the business leadership and is responsible for business strategy and commercial decisions of the business. They are usually interested in the value proposition of a project and the commercial viability of the integration.  [Learn more](/business-integration/BusinessComercial.md)

## Business Operations
This stakeholder group is usually interested in how the integration will work from a financial perspective. They are interested in the business operations that will be involved to bring the integration alive. They will be interested in the accounting schema, integration rules, settlement and fees implementation. There is definitely an intersection between this group and what management would because the business operations team implements the priorities of management.

They will be interested in issues concerning API integration, security, technical operation of the integration, account creation. [Learn more](/technical-integration/TechnicalIntegration.md)

## Conclusion 
There is an intersection between the interests of management, business operations and technical operations when it comes to an integration, but a separation of concerns is important as it is easier to locate exactly what you are looking for depending on where it is documented.
