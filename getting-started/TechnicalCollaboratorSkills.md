# Technical Collaborator Skills
|Skill Set | Description |
|-- |-- |
|Node.js and TypeScript:| The project involves building a microservice using Node.js and TypeScript. Proficiency in both of these technologies is essential for developing robust and scalable server-side applications.|
|RESTful API Design:| Understanding and implementing API design principles is crucial for building the custom component that connects with the core banking systems and other standard integration components. This includes designing endpoints, handling HTTP methods, and ensuring proper data exchange formats like JSON.|
| Microservices Architecture:| Familiarity with microservices architecture is important for designing the system in a modular and scalable way. This involves breaking down the application into smaller, loosely coupled services that can be independently developed, deployed, and maintained. |
|Financial Domain Knowledge | Understanding financial concepts, such as transactions, accounts, balances, and authentication mechanisms like OAuth2, is essential for building integrations with core banking systems. Knowledge of financial regulations and compliance standards may also be necessary, depending on the specific requirements. |
| Security Best Practices | Given the sensitive nature of financial data, implementing security best practices is critical.|
|Error Handling and Logging | Implementing robust error handling and logging mechanisms is essential for diagnosing issues and ensuring the reliability of the system. This includes handling exceptions gracefully, logging relevant information for troubleshooting, and monitoring system health.| 
| Testing and Quality Assurance | Writing comprehensive unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests is crucial for ensuring the reliability and correctness of the software. Knowledge of testing frameworks like Jest or TTK, as well as techniques such as mocking and stubbing, is valuable for this purpose. |
| Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) | Implementing CI/CD pipelines automates the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes, leading to faster release cycles and improved software quality. Familiarity with tools like CircleCI, or GitHub Actions is beneficial for setting up these pipelines. | 
| Version Control | Proficiency in version control systems like Git is essential for collaborating with team members, managing code changes, and tracking the history of the project. |
